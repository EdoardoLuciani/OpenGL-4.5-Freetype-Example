# OpenGL-4.5-Freetype-Example
This is a simple example of writing text using OpenGL 4.5 and the freetype library. The libraries used in this project are not included but here are the links to download them from the official websites:

glm: (openGL mathematics) https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html
glfw: https://www.glfw.org/
glew: http://glew.sourceforge.net/

Make sure to include the header and the library in the your compiler option, and to put the .dll in the folder of your project.
